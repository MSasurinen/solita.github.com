It is again time to take a look at the latest Solita Developer Survey results! In this posting, we'll examine what kind of tools, technologies and processes we use to do our daily work at Solita.

## Who Responded

This year we had 322 responses from six Solita countries. Most of the responses (201) came from Solita's origins Finland - Denmark was the second with 80 and Poland the third with 34 responses. Sweden (4), Estonia (2) and Belgium (1) had only a minor representation. The most common job role was still a Full-stack developer (172), followed by Backend developer (108) and Software architect (66). 38% of us said, they mostly work remotely from home. Interestingly, in Denmark all respondents work at the office where as in Poland almost everyone works remotely. Finland has a mixture of these two.  

## Competence Development
In software industry, it's essential to keep one's own skills relevant. Usually, the every day customer work offers many possibilities to develop oneself further. On top of that, 59% of the respondents say they spend at least some time on side projects or open source contributions. That's quite a high number. On average, when asked how well can you develop your competences in your working time, the result was 4.52 points out of 7 which can be considered quite good. As the most popular learning platform, Youtube is still number one, followed by O'Reilly and Udemy. Of the developer conferences, our developers have followed Apply WWDC, Google I/O, AWS re:Invent and Disobey, to name but a few. On top of external conferences, [Solita has its own DevDay](https://dev.solita.fi/2021/12/13/devday-of-solita.html) where we spend every year a whole day with internal conference talks on multiple tracks, and have dinner and fun in the evening. 

## OS, IDE and Tooling
When it comes to building something, you need proper tools. The ones you know, the ones you trust, or the ones you would like to learn. As the leading operating system, Windows had 48% share, followed by Mac 43% and Linux 9%. The most popular Linux distibution was Ubuntu, as usual. The most used IDE/editor was Visual Studio Code with 61%, followed by IntelliJ IDEA 45%. A developer can use more than one IDE, depending on the work context. Some of our hard core developers have always had tough discussions between Vim vs. Emacs - this time, Vim beat this race with 28 vs. 11 users.    

## Programming Languages and Software Stacks
For many, the most important thing in software development is the programming language. Some feel they are all just tools, while others are passionate and would not like to switch their favourite language at any cost. In 2024, our most popular language to work with was C# with 28%, followed by TypeScript 15%, Kotlin 11%, Java 10%, Clojure 7% and Python 6%. There is obviously a difference with the most liked and most used programming language too: the reality is that the most used one was SQL with 63% (almost all applications have a database) - also frontend behemoths TypeScript 61% and JavaScript 60% were among top three most used ones. Interestingly, 2024 is the first time TypeScript has surpassed the plain JavaScript - we expect this trend to continue. Also C#, Go and Swift saw rising adoption.

When it comes to databases, PostgreSQL keeps the lead with a good margin. We also see cloud-based managed databases gain popularity, such as Azure SQL and Amazon Aurora. Oracle, MongoDB and MariaDB were in decline.

## CI/CD Pipelines, Deployments and DevOps
To ensure stress-free (and almost bug-free) releases, you need proper continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Here we see a major, yet not unexpected, shift: Jenkins has given way to cloud-based solutions from the pole position to number four. Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions have taken the undisputed lead, followed by Gitlab CI. This reflects in wider adoption of cloud-based environments generally. When many of our customers shift their operations from on-prem to cloud, it also impacts the tooling used for CI, packaging and deployment.

## Testing, Monitoring and Security
While the public cloud solutions gain popularity, also the willingness to invest in testing, monitoring and security increases. This can be seen in the results in our survey as well. In test automation maturity, the biggest winner is automated security tests almost doubling its adoption to 13% of respondents. On the monitoring side, almost all items saw a mall rise, such as client-side error logging, performance monitoring, automated alerts and audit logs. In general, this probably stems from customers' higher awareness about possible risks if logging, monitoring or security are neglected.

## Generative AI - Adoption Rate and Usage
One of the hot potatoes in our industry is of course the Generative AI, or GenAI. While we recognize and actively seek ways to take advantage of its potential, these techs feel sometimes overly hyped too. More often than not, you still need human interaction to actually define the problem and plan the solution accordingly, before you can throw in the tech tools. 38% of the respondents use GenAI daily and 26% weekly, so you can say most of us do use GenAI in our daily work. The methods vary, depending on the needs, personal know-how and even customer policies. We have internal discussion channels and info sessions on various GenAI methods and possibilities to play around with them in sandbox environments. The most popular GenAI services were GenAI chats (90%), GitHub CoPilot 59% and image creators such as Dall-E (27%). But there are many people who go beyond these: things like OpenAI API, LLMs and neural networks, and M365 Copilot are reported to be used by many. GenAI is used for example to help decision making, code autocompletion, aiding to create test code, explain erros and automating routine tasks.   

## Developer Experience (What Do We Value)
For the first time, our survey also had a section called Developer Experience, or DevX. There we wanted to know, what kind of things our experts value the most, in terms of customership, development environment, used practises and needed support. Some of the the most important things for us in this perspective were:
- I can act according to my own values in my work
- I can set up my development environment easily
- I can influence the improvement of development practises
- I feel comfortable asking my teammates for help
- Support from the project lead (e.g. priorities and decision making)

## Career Opportunities at Solita
We seek constantly more people who enjoy solving customer problems with tech, and are eager to develop their skills
further. You'll find our open jobs at [www.solita.fi/en/careers/](https://www.solita.fi/en/careers/).
